# Session: Disable CI E2E Tests

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Agent**: Sonnet 4.5
**Command**: Configuration update
**Zone**: CI/CD, Testing

## Context

Disabling API E2E tests in CI workflow and health-check script to improve CI performance and reduce flakiness.

## Objective

1. Comment out e2e job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. Update `health-check` script in `package.json` to skip e2e tests
3. Document the changes and reasoning

## Changes Made

### 1. CI Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

- ✅ Commented out entire e2e job block
- ✅ Added documentation explaining why it's disabled
- ✅ Kept configuration intact for future re-enabling

**Details**:

- Added clear comment block explaining:
  - E2E tests are resource-intensive and can be flaky
  - Tests are still available for manual runs
  - Suggests re-enabling for scheduled runs or pre-release validation
- All configuration preserved with # comments for easy restoration

### 2. Package Scripts (package.json)

- ✅ Updated `health-check` script to exclude `npm run e2e:all`
- ✅ Kept `health-check:clean` script inheriting the change
- ✅ Kept `e2e:all` and `e2e:clean` scripts available for manual runs

**Before**:

```json
"health-check": "npm run lint:all && npm run test:all && npm run e2e:all"
```

**After**:

```json
"health-check": "npm run lint:all && npm run test:all"
```

## Reasoning

**Why disable E2E in CI?**

- E2E tests are more resource-intensive and slower
- Can be flaky in CI environment
- Can be run manually when needed
- Unit tests and linting provide sufficient coverage for most changes

**What's still available?**

- Manual E2E runs: `npm run e2e:all`
- Clean E2E runs: `npm run e2e:clean`
- Individual E2E tests: `npx nx e2e api-e2e` or `npx nx e2e web-e2e`

**Alternative approaches**:

- Run E2E tests on schedule (e.g., nightly builds)
- Run E2E tests manually before releases
- Re-enable for specific branches (e.g., release branches)

## Testing

✅ Changes complete and ready for testing:

- Verify CI runs successfully without e2e job
- Verify `npm run health-check` skips e2e tests
- Verify `npm run e2e:all` still works for manual testing

## Files Modified

1. [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml#L90-L128)
2. [package.json](package.json#L15-L16)

## Status

- ✅ Complete
